# PopMachineDispenser

## About 
Welcome to my C pop machine. In this program a pop will be dispensed once the correct amount of money is entered.
The user is responsible for pricing pops. 

## Functions
To set the price of a pop an amount must be entered in the command line while executing the program. The amount entered
should be in cents.

Any combinations of quarters ('Q', 'q') , dimes ('D', 'd'), and nickels ('N', 'n') can be entered to retrieve the pop. There is not limit on the number of quarters, dimes, or nickels available to the user.  

'E' or 'e' can be entered at any time to exit the program.
