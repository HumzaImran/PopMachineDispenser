# PopMachineDispenser
Welcome to my C pop machine. In this program a pop will be dispensed once the correct amount of money is provided.
The user is responsible for pricing pops. 

## Functions
To set the price of a pop an amount must be entered in the command line while executing the program. The amount entered
should be in cents.

Any combinations of quarters (Q, q) , dimes (D, d), and nickels (N, n) can be entered to retrieve the pop. There is not limit on the number of quarters, dimes, or nickels available to the user. 

A return (R, r) function is available to have all the money entered  returned before the pop is dispended.  

E, e can be entered at any time to exit the program.
