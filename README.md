# Pop Machine Dispenser

## About 
Welcome to my C pop machine. The goal of this program is to price and purchase a pop. In this program a pop will be dispensed once the correct amount of money is entered. The user is responsible for pricing and purchasing the pop.

## Functions

### Pricing Pop
To set the price of a pop an amount must be entered in the command line while executing the program. The amount entered should be in cents.

***Example Code***  
./Popmachinedispenser 100   
The code above would assign each pop to be 100 cents. 


### Purchasing Pop
To purchase the pop any combinations of quarters, dimes, and nickels can be entered to retrieve the pop. There is not limit on the number of quarters, dimes, or nickels available to the user.  
The letter ‘Q’ represent quarters.    
The letter ‘D’ represent dimes.     
The letter ‘N’represent nickels.     
'E' can be entered at any time to exit the program.  
None of the letters are case sensitive
